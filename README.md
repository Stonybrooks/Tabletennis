# Tabletennis
A core framework for running a tabletennis system with players, rating, and more

The goal is to create a framework for a system, where you can create tabletennis matches 
against other players, and when matches are approved, the system will calculate a new 
ELO rating for each player who participated. 

This framework is meant as a add-on to another C# project, such as a website, a web api or console app.
